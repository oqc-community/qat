Our Responsibilities

The project maintainers are entrusted with upholding this code of conduct.
Enforcing this code is crucial for maintaining a positive, welcoming and productive environment.
Instances of inappropriate behaviour can be reported to the project team using this
`form <https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeyEX_txP3JDF3RQrI3R7ilPHV9JcZIyHPwLLlF6Pz7iGnocw/viewform?usp=sf_link>`_
All grievances will be reviewed confidentially, punctually and impartially.
The moderators have the authority to edit, remove, or decline comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions
that conflict with this code of conduct.
Contributors who disregard this code may face temporary or permanent consequences, as determined by the project team.

|

-----------------------
Applicability
-----------------------

This code of conduct is applicable within project spaces, encompassing project repositories, issue trackers,
communication channels, mailing lists, social media platforms and public events.

|

-----------------------
Enforcement guidelines
-----------------------

The project team will use the following steps to enforce the standards of conduct.

- Warning: In the case of a single incident, the project team will issue a warning to the offending party.
- Temporary Ban: If the offending party does not heed the warning and repeats behaviour which violates the code of
  conduct, the offending party will be temporarily banned.
  This will prohibit the offending party from any interaction with the community for a specified period of time.
  Violating this may result in a permanent ban.
- Permanent Ban: Sustained behaviour which violates the code of conduct will not be tolerated and will result in a
  permanent ban.

Please note that the project team will at its absolute discretion, depending on the nature of the offence, decide the
appropriate consequences for the offending party and that the listed steps are only guidelines and may not necessarily
be applied in the presented order (e.g. a permanent ban can be issued without preceding warnings if the offence warrants
it).
If the project team bans a contributor and you consider this to be unjustified, please communicate this to the project
moderators in private by emailing `qat_moderators@oqc.tech <qat_moderators@oqc.tech>`_.
