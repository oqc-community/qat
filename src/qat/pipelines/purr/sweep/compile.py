    """A pipeline that shims support for compiling instruction builders with sweeps and
    devices assigns by making repeated calls to an underlying pipeline.

    The underlying pipeline must be updateable. This is done because applying device assigns
    can change properties of the hardware model, and the pipeline must be rebuilt to ensure
    it is not invalidated. Furthermore, even if device assigns aren't used, sweeps are
    often done side-by-side with changes to the hardware model, so it is useful to ensure
    its rebuilt as a precaution.

    Eventually the risks associated with device assigns can be mitigated by mapping device
    assigns onto instructions in the IR, where possible. For example, a device assign that
    changes the frequency of a channel can be mapped onto a frequency set instruction.
    Similar behaviour could implemented for pulse channel scales too, with an e.g.
    "set scale" instruction, or appropriate mapping onto pulse amplitudes.
