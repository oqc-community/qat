class PassManager(PassInfoMixin):
    """Contains a sequence of passes.

    Represents a sequential composite of passes, which can be composites themselves.
    Although not explicitly specified, the pass manager is best modelled as a DAG that acts
    as a pass itself. In doing so, it runs a sequence of (composite or leaf) passes over the
    input and aggregates results from them.

    Result aggregation (in general) can be achieved via return values or side effects. We
    adopted the latter approach where a :class:`ResultManager` is passed in as argument. The
    rationale behind this choice is two-fold:

    #. Allow passes to peek, use, or potentially invalidate results via the ResultManager
       without burdening their parent :class:`PassManager`.
    #. Let the passes and results define their dependency graphs on the fly which saves us
       from explicitly building and maintaining them. Here it's also a possible direction to
       let passes lazily declare, create, and run their dependencies as they get discovered.

    Result aggregation would also potentially involve cache handling as described in the
    :class:`ResultManager`. This calls for proper pass identification, cache invalidation,
    and pass/result cycle detection techniques.

    Example of a DAG:

    (PM1 A B (PM2 C D ) E F) can be thought of as:

    .. code-block::

                <---PM2--->

                   --> C
        A --> B --|    â†“
                   --> D --> E --> F

        <-----------PM1------------>

    Although the notation of a given (sub-) DAG looks sequential, passes within can run
    sequentially or in parallel depending on their inter-dependencies.

    Notes thus far describe an ideal fully-fledged PassManager. However, today's needs are
    very simple as we barely have visible features of modular quantum compilation workflow.
    It is therefore wise to keep the implementation light and basic where component passes
    run and register their own results within the :class:`ResultManager` passed in as
    argument. Another reason is the possibility in the near future to adopt and tap into
    existing and mature pass pipeline infrastructure which saves us from reinventing or
    rediscovering the same concepts already covered by the opensource community.
