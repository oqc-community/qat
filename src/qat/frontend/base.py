    Base class for frontend that scans a high-level language-specific, but target-agnostic, input
    :class:`QatInput` and verifies its syntax and semantics according to a specific source language
    (QASM, QIR, ...). The input is optimised so as to adhere to the underlying topology of the QPU
    and is then compiled to a target-agnostic intermediate representation (IR) :class:`QatIR` that
    can be further optimised in the middle end.

    Generally, frontends are picked to match the source language. For example, a QIR source
    program should be coupled with the :class:`QIRFrontend`. They implement compilation
    details that are specific to the source language via a pipeline, and parse it down to
    QAT IR.
