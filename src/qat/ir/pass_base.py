class PassManager(PassInfoMixin):
    """
    Represents a sequential composite of passes, which can be composites themselves. Although not explicitly
    specified, the pass manager is best modelled as a DAG that acts as a pass itself. In doing so, it runs
    a sequence of (composite or leaf) passes over some unit of IR and aggregates results from them.

    Result aggregation (in general) can be achieved via side effects or simply return values. We adopted
    the latter approach where a ResultManager is passed in as argument. The rationale behind this choice
    is two-fold:

    1) Allow passes to peek, use, or potentially invalidate results via the ResultManager without burdening
    their parent PassManager.

    2) Let the passes and results define their dependency graphs on the fly which saves us from explicitly
    building and maintaining them. Here it's also a possible direction to let passes lazily declare, create,
    and run their dependencies as they get discovered.

    Result aggregation would also potentially involve cache handling as described in the ResultManager.
    This calls for proper pass identification, cache invalidation, and pass/result cycle detection techniques.

    Example of a DAG:

    (PM1 A B (PM2 C D ) E F) can be thought of as:

            <---PM2--->

               --> C
    A --> B --|    â†“
               --> D --> E --> F

    <-----------PM1------------>

    Although the notation of a given (sub-) DAG looks sequential, passes within can run sequentially
    or in parallel depending on their inter-dependencies.

    Notes thus far describe an ideal fully-fledged PassManager. However, today's needs are very simple as we barely
    have visible features of modular quantum compilation workflow. It is therefore wise to keep the implementation
    light and basic where component passes run and register their own results within the ResultManager passed
    in as argument. Another reason is the possibility in the near future to adopt and tap into existing and mature
    pass pipeline infrastructure which saves us from reinventing or rediscovering the same concepts already covered
    by the opensource community.

    Organisation, registering, visibility, and discovery of pipelines w.r.t the global quantum compilation

    the traditional "hand-me-down" cascade-like compilation stages is likely to shift as QAT matures.

    analyses results, and uses those results for its purpose.
