## Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

We are incredibly thankful for the contributions we receive from the community. 

If you would like to contribute to our project, you must first agree to our Contributor License Agreement (CLA). This allows a contributor to retain their ownership in the code submitted while granting us with the necessary legal rights to use that contribution. By contributing to OQC’s Qat project (Project), and in consideration of being granted permission to be involved in it and to publicise your contributions through it, you agree to the following CLA terms and conditions, which shall apply to all your past, present and future contributions to the project. 

Agreeing to this CLA explicitly states that you are entitled to provide a contribution (Contribution), that you cannot withdraw permission to use your Contribution at a later date, and that you grant OQC (as defined below), its licensees, successors and assigns permission to use your Contribution in commercial products without further reference or any payment to you.

## Definitions

“You” (or “Your”) shall mean the copyright owner or legal entity authorised by the copyright owner that is making this CLA with the Project. For legal entities, the entity making a Contribution and all other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that entity are considered to be a single Contributor. For the purposes of this definition, “control” means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

“Contribution” shall mean the code, documentation or other original works of authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally submitted by You to the Project for inclusion in, or documentation of, any of the products owned or managed by the Project (the “Work”). For the purposes of this definition, “submitted” means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication or upload sent to the Project or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Project for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work.

## License

You hereby represent that all present, past and future contributions are governed by the BSD-3 copyright statement unless stipulated otherwise. This entails that to the extent possible under law, you transfer all copyright and related or neighboring rights of the code or documents you contribute to the Project itself or its maintainers. Furthermore, you also represent that you have the authority to perform the above waiver with respect to the entirety of your Contributions.

You hereby grant to OQC and to recipients of software distributed by the Project a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute Your Contributions and such derivative works. Such license shall be freely assignable and sub-licensable.

OQC may add to or change these Terms and Conditions without notice including updating, amending, or varying this agreement or introducing a new licensing arrangement. As such You agree that OQC is entitled to amend these Terms and Conditions at any time without Your prior permission. 

## Moral Rights

To the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, you hereby waive, and agree not to assert, any or all of your “moral rights” in or relating to Your Contributions for the benefit of the project.

## Third Party Content

If Your Contribution includes or is based on any source code, object code, bug fixes, configuration changes, tools, specifications, documentation, data, materials, feedback, information or other works of authorship that were not authored by you (“Third Party Content”) or if You are aware of any third party intellectual property or proprietary rights associated with your Contribution (“Third Party Rights”), then you agree to include with the submission of Your Contribution full details respecting such Third Party Content and Third Party Rights, including, without limitation, identification of which aspects of your Contribution contain Third Party Content or are associated with Third Party Rights, the owner/author of the Third Party Content and Third Party Rights, where You obtained the Third Party Content, and any applicable third party license terms or restrictions respecting the Third Party Content and Third Party Rights. If use of any Third Party Consent requires a license then you must obtain one. For greater certainty, the foregoing obligations respecting the identification of Third Party Content and Third Party Rights do not apply to any portion of a Project that is incorporated into Your Contribution to that same Project.

## Representations

You represent that, other than the Third Party Content and Third Party Rights identified by you in accordance with this Agreement, you are the sole author of your Contributions and are legally entitled to grant the foregoing licenses and waivers in respect of your Contributions. If your Contributions were created in the course of your employment with your past or present employer(s), you represent that such employer(s) has authorised you to make your Contributions on behalf of such employer(s) or such employer (s) has waived all of their right, title or interest in or to your Contributions.

## Disclaimer

To the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, your Contributions are provided on an "as is" basis, without any warranties or conditions, express or implied, including, without limitation, any implied warranties or conditions of non-infringement, merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. You are not required to provide support for your Contributions, except to the extent you desire to provide support.

## No Obligation
You acknowledge that OQC is under no obligation to use or incorporate your contributions into the Project. The decision to use or incorporate your contributions into the Project will be made at the sole discretion of OQC or its authorised delegates.

## Severability
If any term of this CLA is held invalid or unenforceable for any reason, the remainder of the term and this CLA will continue in full force and effect.

## Law and jurisdiction
This CLA and any dispute or claim (including non-contractual disputes or claims) arising out of or in connection with it or its subject matter or formation shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the law of England and Wales. OQC and You irrevocably agree that the courts of England and Wales shall have exclusive jurisdiction to settle any dispute or claim (including non-contractual disputes or claims) arising out of or in connection with this CLA or its subject matter or formation provided that OQC may apply for an injunction or other interim relief and enforce a judgment awarded it by the English courts in any court of competent jurisdiction.
