This is a minimal version of **QAT**, that allows creation and serialisation of compiler configuration settings.

**QAT** (Quantum Assembly Toolkit/Toolchain) is a low-level quantum compiler and runtime which facilitates executing quantum IRs
such as `QASM <https://openqasm.com/>`_, `OpenPulse <https://openqasm.com/language/openpulse.html>`_ and
`QIR <https://devblogs.microsoft.com/qsharp/introducing-quantum-intermediate-representation-qir/>`_ against QPU drivers.
It facilitates the execution of largely-optimised code, converted into abstract pulse-level and hardware-level instructions,
which are then transformed and delivered to an appropriate driver.

For more information, please see the `main package <https://pypi.org/project/qat-compiler/>`_.
