Welcome to the QAT documentation!

It's still under construction, so things may be a little rough. Right now we have a basic overview of its main concepts and API documentation. More will be coming soon.

If you want to know what the project is about go to the `introduction <intro.html>`_. If you want to jump in and start using it, check the `quick start <quick-start.html>`_.
